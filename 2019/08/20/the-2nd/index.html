In order to achieve this goal, they be indifferent to their children, abuse even beat them. Do you think they don’t love children? If you think so ,  you wronged them. At least most parents really love their children. But this kind of love is unreasonable love. In their eyes, children are not children, but a part of themselves, an extension of themselves, a carrier of their own will. So they give what they think is good to their children, and take what they think is bad from their children. For that, there are a series of situations that parents force their children to do what they don’t want to do, from “your parents forced you to learn the piano” to “your parents forced you to break up”, “your parents forced you to have many blind dates” to “some parents forced their children to study medicine, take the civil service exam…”.They regard their children as their own extension, and press their unfinished dreams on their children’s shoulders, and force them to do what they want them to do . When the children take the college entrance examination, they think that they did not enroll in the normal college in that year, so they force the children to apply for the normal college. When the child learns broadcasting host, he insists that he give a performance to his uncle and aunt.This desire for ownership and control is not only embodied in children, but also in children’s possessions, so children have no privacy, they must to read their children’s diaries , cellphone message and QQ, in order to prevent anything bad happens. So children’s toys can be freely given away, no matter how the children cry, parents still can not understand, “Is a broken Teddy bear?”  As for it ? “ This is obviously not to regard children as independent person, never thinking from the perspective of children, but to regard their values as natural.I’m not trying to prove how selfish parents are.I just want to say that they don’t  take  the right position. At any rate, they child is not an accessory to you. they can’t just walk on their footprints. Because all healthy and good relationships between people in the world are based on equality, even the relationship between parents and children should be based on equality and mutual respect.I love my parents very much.Although they are ordinary, they are all trying to love me in their way.When I make mistakes, they point out, and sometimes they make mistakes, and I often communicate with them, our feelings improve in communication.As I have said, maybe the motivation to love is innate, but feelings are nurtured bit by bit. We should all benefit and grow in this process.","dateCreated":"2019-08-20T18:55:10+08:00","dateModified":"2019-08-21T15:29:54+08:00","datePublished":"2019-08-20T18:55:10+08:00","description":"","headline":"写给聪明人","image":[],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://ultralyp.github.io/2019/08/20/the-2nd/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Liang Yinping","sameAs":["https://github.com/","http://stackoverflow.com/users","https://twitter.com/","https://facebook.com/","https://plus.google.com/","https://www.linkedin.com/profile/","mailto"]},"url":"https://ultralyp.github.io/2019/08/20/the-2nd/","keywords":"文集"}</script>
